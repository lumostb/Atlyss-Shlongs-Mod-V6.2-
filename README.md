# Atlyss-Shlongs-Mod-V6.2-
## A small QoL UI mod which tweaks some data shown on the toolbars for convenience purposes.

## Enemy HP values
The exact current+max HP of each enemy is now displayed on their HP bar when you target them. Also shows correct values for bosses and HP-scaled enemies based on party size.
Enemies that fall below below 30% HP and are susceptible to Execute are now displayed in orange.

## Action skill & Quick item cooldown
The exact amount of seconds before you can use an action skill or a quick consumable is now shown.

## XP required to next level
The amount of XP required to reach the next level, relative between your current XP and the XP threshold of the next level, is now shown alongside your current total XP.

## Persistent player character memory
If a player disconnects from a game on one character and reconnects on another character, the name of the previous character is notified to the client so players can more easily recognise them.
